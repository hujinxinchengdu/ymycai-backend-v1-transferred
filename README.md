## Development Setup

### Pre-commit hooks

- No need for extra steps if you do not use ***Github Desktop***:
  - Github Desktop is not compatible with pre-commit hooks because the Git version included with GitHub Desktop is a compressed edition. You can work around this problem by replacing the bundled Git in GitHub Desktop with the official version of Git. Please refer to [the solution here](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_40920751/article/details/121970779)

### Installation

1. Install node.js v18.16.1
2. Run `npm install`.
